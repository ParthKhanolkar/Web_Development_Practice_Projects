        <h2>The Following is a timeline of his life</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1917</strong> - Was born by the name Jacob Kurtzberg at 147 Essex Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City.</li>
            <li><strong>1935</strong> - Began working for the movie animation company Fleischer Studios as an inbetweener (an artist who fills in the action between major-movement frames) on Popeye cartoons</li>
            <li><strong>1936</strong> - Joined the Lincoln Newspaper Syndicate. Worked there on newspaper comic strips and on single-panel advice cartoons</li>
            <li><strong>1937</strong> - Left the Studio before the Fleischer strike.</li>
            <li><strong>1940</strong> - As the comic book industry gained popularity, Kirby moved on to comic-book publisher and newspaper syndicator Fox Feature Syndicate. He began to explore superhero narrative with the comic strip The Blue Beetle</li>
            <li><strong>1943</strong> - In the wake of World War II, Kirby was drafted into the U.S. Army on June 7.</li>
            <li><strong>1950</strong> - After the war, Kirby started working at Harvard Comics. He created such titles as the kid-gang adventure Boy Explorers Comics, the kid-gang Western Boys' Ranch, the superhero comic Stuntman, and, in vogue with the fad for 3-D movies, Captain 3-D.</li>
            <li><strong>1954</strong> - Atlas Comics had relaunched Captain America in a new series. Kirby created a similar superhero known as <i>Fighting American</i>.</li>
            <li><strong>1958</strong> - Began his work for Marvel Comics. Initially with Christopher Rule as his regular inker, and later Dick Ayers, Kirby drew across all genres, from romance comics to war comics to crime comics to Western comics, but made his mark primarily with a series of supernatural-fantasy and science fiction stories featuring giant, drive-in movie-style monsters with names like Groot, the Thing from Planet X; Grottu, King of the Insects; and Fin Fang Foom.</li>
            <li><strong>1968</strong> - Joe Simon was involved in litigation with Marvel Comics over the ownership of Captain America, initiated by Marvel after Simon registered the copyright renewal for Captain America in his own name. According to Simon, Kirby agreed to support the company in the litigation and, as part of a deal Kirby made with publisher Martin Goodman, signed over to Marvel any rights he might have had to the character.</li>
            <li><strong>1970</strong> - Started working for DC comics. He produced a series of interlinked titles under the blanket sobriquet "The Fourth World", which included a trilogy of new titles — New Gods, Mister Miracle, and The Forever People — as well as the extant Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen.</li>
            <li><strong>1975</strong> - Returned to Marvel with Stan Lee. Kirby both wrote and drew the monthly Captain America series as well as the Captain America's Bicentennial Battles one-shot in the oversized treasury format.</li>
            <li><strong>1980</strong> - Kirby and Pacific Comics, a new, non-newsstand comic-book publisher, made one of the industry's earliest deals for creator-owned series, resulting in Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers, and the six-issue miniseries Silver Star (later collected in hardcover format in 2007). This, together with similar actions by other independent comics publishers as Eclipse Comics (where Kirby co-created the character Destroyer Duck in a benefit comic-book series published to help Steve Gerber fight a legal case against Marvel), helped establish a precedent to end the monopoly of the work-for-hire system, wherein comics creators, even freelancers, had owned no rights to characters they created.</li>
            <li><strong>1993</strong> - Kirby retained ownership of characters used in multiple series of what the company dubbed "The Kirbyverse". He established a legacy in his name in the history of comics and was loved and respected all over the world for his work.</li>
            <li><strong>1994</strong> - Died at age 76 of heart failure in his Thousand Oaks, California, home.</li>
